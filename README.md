# ODSC_West_2017

This repository contains the mataterials for my ODSC West 2017 talk "R Tools for Data Science" which will take place on Friday,
11/3/17 at 11AM.

The major files for the talk are:
* R Tools for Data Science.Rmd
* R Tools for Data Science.nb.html
* ML_with_caret.Rmd
* ML_with_caret.nb.html
* R_Keras_TensorFlow.Rmd
* R_Keras_TensorFlow.nb.html
* R_sparklyr_Spark.Rmd
* R_sparklyr_Spark.nb.html

It is not necessary to download these files beforehand. However, you are welcome to do so if it will help you follow along.
I do plan to walk through much of the code. However, our one and one-half hour time slot is not long enough for interactive practice.

Best regards,    
Joseph Rickert
